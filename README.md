During December the chassis was prepared with a few altercations here
and there. The design underwent a few changes. During the month of
January the design was finalised with the help of a few seniors and further
work on the chassis continued with the motor and the encoder being
attached and the channels being constructed on i.

The whole electronics part had to be done mainly in Matlab and Arduino. In
Matlab, given map of the restaurant having the locations of the fixed
tables, an optimised shortest path avoiding the tables had to be calculated
from the current location of the bot to the table from where the ordered
have been made. That has already been completed(Dec). The next step is to
send the results to the arduino for further steps.
Coming to Arduino, the data sent from matlab will be used to navigate the
bot throught the optimised path. The function for straight line movement
between the discontinuites and changing direction after encountering a
discontinuity is complete(Dec-Jan).Testing the bot and
combining the above steps in main function which would take not much
time after the chassis is complete and we may start testin in real life.
